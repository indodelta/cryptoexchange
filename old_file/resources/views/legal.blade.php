                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6.1. No one is authorized or allowed to access this Site or use the Services unless he, she or it has signed this Agreement. Such signature does not need to be a physical signature, since electronic acceptance of this Agreement is permitted by various jurisdictions’ laws, such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and similar legislation. You manifest your agreement to this Agreement by taking any act demonstrating your assent thereto. Most likely, you have clicked or will click a button containing the words “I agree” or some similar syntax. You should understand that this has the same legal effect as you placing your physical signature on any other legal contract. If you click any link, button or other device provided to you in any part of our Site’s interface, then you have legally agreed to all of these Terms and Conditions. Additionally, by using any part of our Site or Services in any manner, including the Exchange, you understand and agree that such use constitutes your affirmation of your complete and unconditional acceptance to all of the terms in this Agreement.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6.2. Even if you fail to sign this Agreement, you understand and agree that you are still bound by the terms of this Agreement by virtue of your viewing the Site or using any portion of the Site or our Services.</span></p>

                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are seeking information regarding any illegal activities, or seeking to engage in any illegal or fraudulent financial activity, please leave this Site immediately and do not attempt to use the Services.

                                <h4><strong>1.8. REVISIONS TO THIS USER AGREEMENT</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.8.1. From time to time, we may revise this Agreement. We reserve the right to do so, in our sole and absolute discretion, and you agree that we have this unilateral right. Your continued use of the Site and the Services shall be deemed acceptance of the then prevailing terms and conditions.

                                <h4><strong>2.2. VIRTUAL CURRENCY</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not provide or issue our Members any virtual currency whatsoever. All virtual currency, including, but not limited to, Bitcoin (“XBT”), exchanged or traded by and between our Members originates from the Members themselves. The Company does not have access to any third-party accounts used by Users or Members to obtain virtual currency. All currencies transferred to us by Members for use with the Exchange are held in an omnibus client account controlled by the Exchange. The Exchange maintains an internal ledger recording how much virtual currency each Member possesses in the omnibus client account, and all transactions between Members are based on such ledger.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.3 NOT A BANK ACCOUNT</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YOUR ACCOUNT WITH US (AND ANY AVAILABLE CURRENCY THEREIN) IS NOT A BANK ACCOUNT, CREDIT CARD or DEPOSITS.

PLEASE NOTE THAT  LLC WILL MAINTAIN DEPOSITORY ACCOUNTS WITH A FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR CUSTOMER CURRENCY, AND CURRENCY DEPOSITED IN SUCH ACCOUNTS WILL BE INSURED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. ALL CURRENCY TRADED OR PURCHASED BY YOU WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT UNTIL USED TO TRADE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OR UNTIL WITHDRAWN BY YOU. </span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.4. DISCLAIMER; RISK FACTORS</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.4.1 We are not responsible for any loss or damage incurred by you as a result of your use of our Services or for your failure to understand the nature of virtual currencies or the market for such currencies. All we are providing you is a method by which you can exchange, trade, and/or store certain virtual currencies, and we make no representations or warranties concerning the value, stability, or legality of any such virtual currencies.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.4.2. You acknowledge the following risks related to your use of the Site and the Services:</span></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of loss in trading virtual currencies such as Bitcoin (collectively, “Digital Assets”) may be substantial and losses may occur over a short period of time.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been subject to large fluctuations in the past and may be subject to large fluctuations in the future.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Assets are not legal tender, not backed by any government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and value of Digital Assets.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Digital Assets transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transactions.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currencies for Digital Assets, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no assurance that a person who accepts Digital Assets as a payment today will continue to do so in the future.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyberattack, and may mean that technological difficulties experienced by the Company may prevent the access or use of your Digital Assets.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any bond or trust account we may hold for your benefit may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by you.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of those risks for you, and that the Company does not give advice or recommendations regarding Digital Assets, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use the Services and the Site at your own risk.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with trading in Digital Assets. &nbsp;You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the funds in your Account (as defined below), and that under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.5. VIRTUAL CURRENCY VALUES</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand and agree that, due to technical and other restrictions, the virtual currency values displayed on our Site may be delayed and therefore not reflect the current, live market value of such currency. Nonetheless, you agree that the values displayed on our Site control your Account and your use of the Site and Services, including the Exchange.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.6 perfektpay MARKET DATA </strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfektpay's market value data is valuable to us, and to the extent that you receive access to such data, you hereby agree that you will not redistribute, retransmit, duplicate, publish or otherwise make such data available in any way, either through automated, manual, or any other means, for the purpose of generating revenue, either directly or indirectly. &nbsp;Any distribution, publication, or transmission of our live market feed without perfektpay's consent is a material breach of this Agreement and a violation of our property rights for which we may seek appropriate legal recourse. &nbsp;You agree that we are not responsible for any adverse consequences that you may experience, or costs that you may incur, arising from any lapse, failure, outage, or error in receiving live market value date from perfektpay.</span></p>

                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to use the Exchange, you must create an account with us (your “Account”). Your Account will be used to store various virtual currency amounts as deposited by you. In creating your Account, you may be asked to provide certain registration details and information. In order to verify your identity, some of this information may be personal, private or detailed.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we or any of our authorized agents have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site and Services by you, as well as subject you to civil liability or refer you to the appropriate law enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution. We shall not be liable to make any compensation, monetary or otherwise, following such suspension, termination or inability to use the Site or the Services. You are responsible for any fees that the Company incurs with respect to your Account. If you fail to reimburse us for any fees within thirty (30) days of our initial demand for reimbursement, you agree that you will pay us one hundred dollars ($100) as liquidated damages, being a genuine pre-estimate of loss and damage suffered by the Company, as well as any costs incurred by the Company for each fee incurred plus interest on the amount owed at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) 1% per month or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.</span></p>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.10 NO ACCOUNT TRANSFERS</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Control or use of your Account may not be transferred, leased, assigned or sold to a third party. We disclaim any and all liability arising from fraudulent entry and use of the Site, Exchange, and other Services (including, but not limited to, liabilities arising from unauthorized trades executed through your Account). If a User fraudulently obtains access to your Account or the Exchange, we may terminate the User’s access and membership immediately and take all necessary and appropriate actions under applicable federal, state, and international laws.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.11. PASSWORD SECURITY</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AS PART OF OUR SECURITY MEASURES AND POLICIES, PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEVER ASK YOU, FOR ANY REASON, WHETHER BY EMAIL, REGULAR MAIL OR TELEPHONE, TO DISCLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD. PASSWORD INQUIRIES WILL ONLY BE CONDUCTED ONLINE AND ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE SIGNED ONTO THE COMPANY’S SITE. WE WILL NEVER SEND YOU EMBEDDED LINKS IN AN EMAIL REQUESTING THAT YOU SIGN ONTO THE SITE BY CLICKING SUCH A LINK. IF YOU RECEIVE AN EMBEDDED LINK BY EMAIL, CLAIMING TO BE FROM US, YOU SHOULD NOT OPEN IT OR CLICK ON THE LINK. THE EMAIL IS NOT FROM US AND IS LIKELY FRAUDULENT. NEVER GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD TO ANYONE WHOM YOU DO NOT INTEND TO AUTHORIZE TO USE YOUR ACCOUNT.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.12. THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide you with the Services, including the Exchange, you may also be required to disclose certain other third-party account information to us, including, without limitation, your bank account number, your Bitcoin addresses and related information. As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, we are not responsible for any unauthorized use of your Account with the Company or any third-party accounts which you use in connection with the Exchange.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.13. FUNDING YOUR ACCOUNT</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After creating your Account with the Company, you will be able to fund your Account by transferring, for example, XBT, from your accounts with such third-party virtual currency providers into your Account operated by the Exchange. No fees are charged by us for funding your Account; however, third parties, such as your bank, may charge transaction and other fees.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, to fund your Account with 100 XBT, you would use the third-party Bitcoin software to transfer your own pre-existing 100 XBT to the Exchange’s Bitcoin address for the omnibus client account. The Exchange would then credit your Account with 100 XBT on the Exchange’s ledger, and you would be able to trade those XBT for USD/EUR/SGD on the Exchange.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.14. TRADING</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your Account has been funded, you may begin to trade your virtual currency with other Members. Trading is accomplished via bids and offers to buy and sell virtual currency. Specific examples and illustrations of how trading works may be found on the Site. We are not responsible for any disputes among or between Members regarding any transaction.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matching bids and offers to buy and sell virtual currency are automatically paired by the Exchange, and the Exchange will notify the respective Members that the order has been executed. Once a match is made, the order is executed and cleared instantaneously. YOU SHOULD ONLY PLACE A BID OR OFFER TO BUY OR SELL IF YOU FULLY INTEND TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. You have the right to stop payment of a preauthorized bid or offer to sell or buy virtual currency by initiating procedures through your Account online to effectuate closure of such open bid or offer.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members may only sell as much virtual currency as is recorded by the Company in the Exchange ledger, plus the applicable Transaction Fee (as defined below). Any attempt by you to sell more virtual currency than our records show exists in your Account after deduction of the applicable Transaction Fee will result in an unsuccessful trade and may be grounds for termination of your Account.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.15 NO REVERSAL OF TRADES</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an order has been executed and the appropriate currencies have been credited and debited from the Members’ Accounts, the transaction may not be reversible. The Exchange simply matches bids and offers put forth by Members and assists Members with carrying out the intent of the Member as expressed via the bid(s) or offer(s).</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.16. FEES FOR MEMBER TRANSACTIONS</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide the Site, Exchange, and other Services to you, we charge a fee on each transaction initiated by Members of the Site (such fee, a “Transaction Fee”). The current Transaction Fee may be found on our Site. We reserve the right to change, modify or increase the Transaction Fee at any time and from time to time. Any such changes, modifications or increases will be effective upon posting such changes, modifications or increases on our Site. If you do not agree to the posted changes, modifications, or increases, you may delete your Account as provided herein. Your first use of your Account following the posting of any changes or revisions to the terms of this Agreement or modified Transaction Fee as posted on the Site will constitute your acceptance of all such changes or revisions.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.17. TRANSACTION FEES DUE FROM BUYER AND SELLER</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transaction Fees are paid by both the buyer Member and seller Member in any given transaction. The XBT buyer and seller will each be charged a fee in USD/EUR/SGD. &nbsp;The Member is responsible for any fees imposed by third parties in connection with transferring virtual currency into the omnibus client account. The Exchange does not charge fees to transfer virtual currency from the omnibus client account. &nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>2.18. WITHDRAWING CURRENCY</strong></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to allowing Members to trade virtual currency, the Exchange allows Members to withdraw virtual currency upon request to us. Members may withdraw all or some of their virtual currency, and there is no minimum amount of virtual currency required to maintain your status as a Member (however, as indicated above, you may only trade or sell virtual currency up to the amount shown as belonging to you in the ledger maintained by the Exchange). XBT currency will be transferred from the Exchange’s account to the specific Bitcoin address provided by the Member. Withdrawals may take up to three (3) days to complete, provided that larger withdrawals may take up to thirty (30) days to complete and that any withdrawal may be delayed as necessary to comply with applicable law and/or the Exchange’s customer identification and anti-money laundering procedures.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.19. STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statement of your available currency balance and the status of your Account is available to you in electronic format for viewing online anytime (subject to down times) at the Site. You may review online all transactions that have taken place in the previous one year. You also have the right to receive a receipt, trade ticket or other evidence of a transaction.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.20. TRADING ERRORS</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that you have been erroneously charged a Transaction Fee, please notify us immediately of such error, along with any additional information concerning the transaction. If we do not hear from you within thirty (30) days after such alleged erroneous Transaction Fee first appears on any Account statement, such fee will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes.</span></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <h4><strong>2.21. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND ACCOUNT</strong></h4>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.21.1. You may close your Account by providing written notice to us, and on such notice, a hold will be placed on your Account to allow all pending transactions to clear, if any. After notifying us of your desire to close your Account, you may only use the Exchange to withdraw the remaining available currency associated with your Account.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.21.2. All currencies appearing in the ledger and attributed to you must be withdrawn or otherwise sold or transferred before cancellation of your Membership and closing of your Account will be finalized.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.21.3. We reserve the right at our sole and absolute discretion to block access to or to suspend, close or terminate your Account if:</span></p>

                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) The trade resulted from an identifiable interruption or malfunction of an Exchange execution or communication system that caused a quote or order to trade in excess of its disseminated size or quote;</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(iii) The trade resulted from an erroneous quote in the primary market for the underlying currency pair that has a width of at least $10.00 or that width is at least three times greater than the average quote width for such underlying security during the time period encompassing five minutes before and after the dissemination of such quote. Underlying market includes various digital currency venues and FX rates; or</span></p>

                                <h3>SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTION AND ACTIVITY REPORTS</h3>
                                <p>The Company will diligently monitor transactions for suspicious activity.&nbsp; Transactions that are unusual will be carefully reviewed to determine if it appears that they make no apparent sense or appear to be for an unlawful purpose.&nbsp; Internal controls will be implemented so that an ongoing monitoring system is in place to detect such activity as it occurs. When such suspicious activity is detected, the Compliance Officer will determine whether a filing with any law enforcement authority is necessary.</p>
                                <p>Suspicious activity can include more than just suspected money laundering attempts.&nbsp; Activity may be suspicious, and the Company may wish to make a filing with a law enforcement authority, even if no money is lost as a result of the transaction.</p>
                                <p>The Compliance Officer will initially make the decision of whether a transaction is potentially suspicious. Once the Compliance Officer has finished his review of the transaction details, he or she will consult with the Company’s senior management to make the decision as to whether the transaction meets the definition of suspicious transaction or activity and whether any filings with law enforcement authorities should be filed.</p>
                                <p>The Compliance Officer will maintain a copy of the filing as well as all <g class="gr_ gr_1038 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="1038" data-gr-id="1038">back up</g> documentation. The fact that a filing has been made is confidential. No one, other than those involved in the investigation and reporting should be told of its existence. In no event should the parties involved in the suspicious activity be told of the filing. The Compliance Officer may inform the Company’s Board of the filing and the underlying transaction.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The Compliance Officer is responsible for directing the annual AML audit of the Company’s operations. The independent audit will be conducted by an independent third party with working knowledge of BSA requirements, or by Company personnel with working knowledge of BSA requirements, none of whom work for the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer will develop corrective action plans for all issues &nbsp;that are raised in the audit and will provide the audit report and all corrective action plans to the Company’s senior management for review. Reports of the corrective action will continue until all are resolved.</p>
